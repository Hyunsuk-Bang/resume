		    <h3>Converting pcap expressions to BPF (Berkeley Packet Filters)</h3>
		    - Developed a compiler that translates pcap expressions into BPF, allowing for more efficient and accurate filtering of network packets<br>
		    - Implemented improvements relative to tcpdump's capability to capture transport layer on top of ipv6<br>
		    - Designed and implemented control flow graph optimization algorithms to improve BPF's execution speed and resource utilization<br>
		    - Conducted extensive testing and debugging to ensure correctness and robustness<br>
		    - Contributed to the open source community, enhancing readability of 'Caper expansion' section in tcpdump.org<br>
		    (<a href = https://gitlab.com/niksu/caper target = "_blank"><u>https://gitlab.com/niksu/caper</u></a>, code is deployed online at <a href = https://www.tcpdump.org/bpfexam/?ver=1.10.4&dlt=EN10MB&snaplen=65535&filter=tcp+or+udp+&cbpf=none target = "_blank"><u>tcpdump.org</u></a>)<br>

		    <h3>Firewall on DPDK(Data Plane Development Kit) for High-bandwidth Network</h3>
		    - Developed a firewall solution utilizing DPDK to handle high-speed network traffic at 100Gbps bandwidth<br>
		    - Conducted performance optimization through utilizing RSS load balancing and DPDK libraries <br>
		    - Administered extensive testing and benchmarking to validate the program's stability, scalability, and performance<br>
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    <h3>HULA (Hop-by-hop Utilization-aware Load balancing Architecture) Load balancer for Data Center</h3>
		    - Built a scalable, adaptable, and programmable congestion aware load balancer for programmable data plane using P4 language<br>
		    - Developed an automated tool to generate fat-tree network topologies based on specified requirements and constraints<br>
		    - Conducted extensive testing and validation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the load balancer<br>
		    - Constructed an automated visualizer to capture the path of packets across the network infrastructure<br><br>
