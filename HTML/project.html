            <h2>Converting pcap expressions to BPF (Berkeley Packet Filters)</h2>
	    - Developed a compiler that translates pcap expressions into BPF, allowing for more efficient and accurate filtering of network packets <br><br>
	    - Implemented improvements relative to tcpdump's capability to capture transport layer on top of ipv6<br><br>
	    - Designed and implemented control flow graph optimization algorithms to improve BPF's execution speed and resource utilization<br><br>
	    - Conducted extensive testing and debugging to ensure correctness and robustness<br><br>
	    - Contributed to the open source community, enhancing readability of 'Caper expansion' section in tcpdump.org<br>
	    (<a href = https://gitlab.com/niksu/caper target = "_blank"><u> https://gitlab.com/niksu/caper</u></a> code is deployed online at tcpdump.org)
            <br><br><br><br>
            <h2>HULA (Hop-by-hop Utilization-aware Load balancing Architecture) Load balancer for Data Center</h2>
	    - Built a scalable, adaptable, and programmable congestion aware load balancer for programmable data plane using P4 language
            <br><br>
	    - Developed an automated tool to generate fat-tree network topologies based on specified requirements and constraints
            <br><br>
	    - Conducted extensive testing and validation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the load balancer
	    <br><br>
	    - Constructed an automated visualizer to capture the path of packets across the network infrastructure
            <br><br><br><br>
            <h2>Paddy Disease Classification</h2>
	    - Engineered a model on a large-scale dataset, achieving an accuracy of 90% using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Tensorflow
            <br><br>
	    - Conducted thorough data analysis and data preprocessing to prepare the data for modeling
            <br><br>
	    - Fine-tuned the hyperparameters to optimize model performance
